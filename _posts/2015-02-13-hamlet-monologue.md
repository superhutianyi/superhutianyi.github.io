Assignment 1: Summer Olympics Medals over Time (using ggplot). The question would be using ggplot to output the charts of Medal Counts over Time, Medal Counts Adjusted by Population, the interactive charts and data table.

Assignment 2: Manhattan Violation Distribution. The question would be using ggmap to output the violation distribution in Manhattan based on the violation code and fine amounts, using both interactive map plots and clusters.

Assignment 3: Text Mining Kickstarter Projects. The question would be using tweets to output the frequency words in tweets, wordclouds, and make sentiment analysis based on that.

Assignment 4: Network Analysis of U.S. Senate Tweets. This question need to use network analysis.

If you are interested about this page, please check out my github page [here](https://github.com/superhutianyi/datavisualization) I have well-done R code there, and you could see several output pictures about the final visualization.
