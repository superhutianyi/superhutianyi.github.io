/Pianist/Extreme Traveller/Love Skiing/Skydiving Experience/Photograph Lover/Pre-Youtuber/Data Analyst
My name is Tianyi Hu. I just graduated from Columbia University last December, with a master’s degree in Quantitative Method of Social Science, where I took courses like Modern Data Structure, Data Visualization, Time Series and Machine Learning. I’ve always had a strong interest in data analyst position. I had solid acadamic foundation in coding languages such as R, Python, SQL and Tableau. Also, born in Tokyo, grew up in Shanghai, and studied in New York broaden my international view to see every item.

Besides, I have plenty of interests. I have practised piano since I was 3, and I got ABRSM diploma five years ago. My favoriate composers are Chopin and Debussy. Lyrics have always been my strength. Also, I love skiing every winter in NY, and I could do both boards. I love travelling, and I have been to many countries like Japan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Canada,  France, Spain and Morocco. I once did a skydiving in Hawaii, and also deep diving in Boracay, Philippines. I like to enjoy a good time in a relaxed life.
